I've written a post or two about new seasons in my time on the internet. Sure, most of them were in my MySpace teenage-angst years, but those count too, don't they?

Fall is upon us and while most people don't think of fall as the season of new beginnings, for me that is exactly what this year is. I branched out on my own as a freelance developer in June of this year, after two years of working at <a href="http://hivemind.co" target="_blank">Hivemind Labs</a>. If independent freelancing wasn't enough to impress you, my first child, <a href="http://instagram.com/cohengsimmons" target="_blank">Cohen Gray</a>, was born a month later. Today I feel as though time is flying and standing still at the same time. I treasure each moment with my son as I see him change and grow every day. Yet I feel like progressing my skills can be so slow moving. There is so much to learn, to see and take in. Who has time for it all?

The answer? No one. Well, maybe.

I'm beginning to see that people who make something of themselves don't complain about their lack of time, they just get out and make things happen. No matter what it takes, they get up, get out, get inspired and do something awesome. I've determined it's high time I stop making excuses and just start making things happen. Let's see where this road leads...
