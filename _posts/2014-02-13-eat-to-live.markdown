I'm going to a wedding today, which always reminds me of my own wedding almost 6 years ago. I love to see where life has taken me. In that today I find myself with one regret, one thing looking back that I'm ashamed of, my weight. OK ok, so I'm not morbidly obese but that does not mean I'm not overweight. To put it in perspective I weighed 150lbs when I got married. Depending on who you talk to that is arguably a touch light for 5' 10" but it's a far cry from the 195.6lbs I weighed this morning.

Maybe you don't think that is a lot but for me this is just not ok anymore and therein lies the problem. The gradual increase was somehow ok over the last few years. I allowed myself to ignore it and pound by pound I found myself heavier than I ever dreamed or desired to be. The decisions I made got me here, but how, how did I let this happen? It's a combination of things, a injury last year. I weighed 172 going into the hospital and a week later came out 189. I've also let myself get too caught up in my work, spending more than 8 hours in a given day sitting in front of a computer. There there is Louisiana, the state where the unwritten motto is, "Live to Eat".

I'm over it, and today I'm saying no more! So how do I change? I think the first step is admitting to the problem. So let's talk about yesterday. I'm going to show you what I ate yesterday. It's going to be utterly embarrassing but I think its necessary. I hope to look back at it one day and feel a sense of pride at my accomplishments. If nothing else it will stand as a reminder that I never want to find myself here again.

**Breakfast** <span class="text-muted"> - I'm watching the baby by myself so I didn't really eat breakfast.</span>

* A bowl of Wheat Thins 10am
	* I didn't want to wake my sleeping baby so I poured a bunch of wheat thins in a bowl. Who knows what a "normal" severing size is.

**Snack** <span class="text-muted"> - Trying to make myself feel better about the crappy wheat thin choice.</span>

* Apple
* Banana

**Lunch** <span class="text-muted"> - I was to lazy to make something so I drove to a local chicken finger place.</span>

* Raising Canes (Box Combo)
	* 4 Chicken Fingers
	* Two Pieces of Texas Toast
	* Large Fry
	* Root Beer

**Snack** <span class="text-muted"> - Not trying to make myself feel better this time. I was just board. I ate all of these within 10 minutes of each other.</span>

* Banana
* Apple
* String Cheese

**Dinner** <span class="text-muted"> - Once again, I can't possibly cook and I'm exhausted from watching the baby, a pizza will do just fine...</span>

* Pizza 6 pieces

**Snack** <span class="text-muted"> - Feeling utter defeat as I look back at my day. One more apple will make it all healthy right?</span>

* Apple

I can't explain to you the low I felt as I took the last bite of that pizza last night. I had eaten 6 pieces all by myself. I looked down and saw myself hovering over a coffee table, watching a movie, pizza box next to me. I was utterly disgusted. I threw away the rest of the pizza and ate an apple a hour or so later as if it would cleanse my body or make up for the pizza in some way.

It was the tipping point. I finally could see I can't do this anymore. This is not who I want to be. This is not what I want to teach my son to be. Someone once told me, "People like you an me, we just aren't built to be that fit", screw that! If you want to accept defeat fine, But I won't be lumped into some statistic. I've made up my mind. I can do this, I will do this!

So how am I going to make the change? CrossFit _(hahah funny that is half of why I'm here)_, Insanity, Tae-Bo., Advocare... Nope, none of the above. In the immediate I'm going to stop eating fast food, lay off the sugar/sweets _(goodbye oreos, it was fun while it lasted)_, and increase the QUALITY of the food I eat. I'm going to use my analytical nature and desire to understand to my advantage. I plan to investigate and learn what my body NEEDS to fuel itself. Then I'm going to gain control over my currently PATHETICALLY WEAK willpower and make better choices. One day at a time.

I plan to post my progress here daily when I can but weekly at a minimum. Short term goal is a beach trip in two months. I'd like to think I could drop 15-20lbs by then but I want keep it realistic and focus on a lifestyle change. I want to take care of myself and teach my children to do the same. Our lives are a result of our choices. So what choice will you make today, Eat to live or live to Eat?
