          <hr>
          <p>There are a lot of companies trying to make the "Minority Report" lifestyle a reality these days. <a href="http://www.insteon.com">Insteon</a> and <a href="http://www.x10.com/">x10</a> are old favorites that have been around for years. More recently, companies like <a href="http://smartthings.com">Smart Things</a> are taking Insteon and x10's tricks and packaging them as more modern products. The nerd in me would LOVE to have an automated home system. Is it practical? No. Does that matter? No.</p>

<p>A few years ago I had a whole budget set aside for an Insteon setup. I was going to spend ~$2000 and have each room on automated lights and a bunch of other fancy tricks. After about a month of planning, reason (aka, my wife), won me over and I decided against the whole setup. Now, just because I didn't actually go through with it back then doesn't mean I've given up on the idea (my wife sighs somewhere in the distance). I continue to keep my eye on the home automation world, hoping that one day I'll be able to have an automated house. Problem is, every time I revisit the idea I find that it's still impractically priced and just not useful. Why? because the automation companies today are building products that will sell as cool toys at Brookstone. They're not useful, practical, home automation tools. Let me explain.</p>

<p>Let's use Smart Things for example. They sell a few products that, depending on your configuration, can provide the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Automated Lights</li>
<li>Be informed of window(s) and door(s) opening/closing</li>
<li>Track temps and motion in a room or on a given object</li>
<li>Know when people come and go</li>
</ul>


<p>Then they partner with quite a few other companies like GE, Schlage, Kwikset and others to provide you with automation products they don't build. Locks, fire alarms, etc.</p>

<p>I'll admit that at first glance of the Smart Things website, they appear to offer a fairly large array of options. Problem is, it's just not practical. To use their system in every room of my house, I'd need the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Door locks: 3 x $200 = $600</li>
<li>Sensors for windows: 8 X 50 = $400</li>
<li>Light accessory for each room: 6 x 50 = $300</li>
<li>A couple motion sensors for fun: 2 x $50 = $100</li>
<li>The Smart Things hub: $100</li>
</ul>


<p>At this point I've spent $1500 to unlock my front door and turn on the lights with my smart phone vs. conventional methods.</p>

<p>Which brings me to my next point. Just because my phone is as smart as a computer doesn't mean I want to "whip it out" to turn on the lights or unlock a door. If I walk in a room and my phone is in my pocket, it's easier to just flip the light switch on the wall than to dig for my phone and open an app. The lights should just turn on when I enter, or via some voice queue. Likewise, trying to get into my house with stuff in my hands would be easier if i didn't have to unlock the door (ignoring that we still have to turn the handle). If I have to put things down to pull out my phone I might as well grab a key. In this scenario, the problem can't be solved by the door just detecting that I'm present either. I don't want it to unlock just because of my proximity. So, we need a better way to solve the problem.</p>

<p>A mobile app to turn on lights or unlock doors is cool but it's just not useful and definitely not going to make the "Minority Report" automated lifestyle a reality. I'm not saying I want everything to be a virtual screen that we wave our hands at, but we've got to do better than extra 3" dongles plugged into our outlets and needing to open an smart phone app to accomplish anything.</p>

<p>What is the answer?
Ultimately, I think technology is still a long way from supporting home automation that would be useful. Technologies like Bluetooth and battery consumption have a long way to go before we can rely on them to make our life simpler.</p>

<p>I do think there are some companies beginning to move in the right direction. <a href="http://nest.com">Nest</a> being one of them. I'll admit the Nest products are not exactly affordable, BUT they do seem to get the idea of what home automation is meant to be. Their products have a "set it and forget it" mindset. I CAN access it and make changes with a smart phone but it's not required for the device to function.</p>

<p>Here's to hoping one day home automation is useful. Then again, I don't want every store I walk in to know I'm out of shorts, maybe "Miniority Report" is a bad model...</p>
