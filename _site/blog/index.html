      <small class="text-muted">Mar 23, 2014 11:15am - Jonathan Simmons </small>
      <hr>
      <p>I'm going to a wedding today, which always reminds me of my own wedding almost 6 years ago. I love to see where life has taken me. In that today I find myself with one regret, one thing looking back that I'm ashamed of, my weight. OK ok, so I'm not morbidly obese but that does not mean I'm not overweight. To put it in perspective I weighed 150lbs when I got married. Depending on who you talk to that is arguably a touch light for 5' 10" but it's a far cry from the 195.6lbs I weighed this morning.</p>

<p>Maybe you don't think that is a lot but for me this is just not ok anymore and therein lies the problem. The gradual increase was somehow ok over the last few years. I allowed myself to ignore it and pound by pound I found myself heavier than I ever dreamed or desired to be. The decisions I made got me here, but how, how did I let this happen? It's a combination of things, a injury last year. I weighed 172 going into the hospital and a week later came out 189. I've also let myself get too caught up in my work, spending more than 8 hours in a given day sitting in front of a computer. There there is Louisiana, the state where the unwritten motto is, "Live to Eat".</p>

<p>I'm over it, and today I'm saying no more! So how do I change? I think the first step is admitting to the problem. So let's talk about yesterday. I'm going to show you what I ate yesterday. It's going to be utterly embarrassing but I think its necessary. I hope to look back at it one day and feel a sense of pride at my accomplishments. If nothing else it will stand as a reminder that I never want to find myself here again.</p>

<p><strong>Breakfast</strong> <span class="text-muted"> - I'm watching the baby by myself so I didn't really eat breakfast.</span></p>

<ul>
<li>A bowl of Wheat Thins 10am

<ul>
<li>I didn't want to wake my sleeping baby so I poured a bunch of wheat thins in a bowl. Who knows what a "normal" severing size is.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Snack</strong> <span class="text-muted"> - Trying to make myself feel better about the crappy wheat thin choice.</span></p>

<ul>
<li>Apple</li>
<li>Banana</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Lunch</strong> <span class="text-muted"> - I was to lazy to make something so I drove to a local chicken finger place.</span></p>

<ul>
<li>Raising Canes (Box Combo)

<ul>
<li>4 Chicken Fingers</li>
<li>Two Pieces of Texas Toast</li>
<li>Large Fry</li>
<li>Root Beer</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Snack</strong> <span class="text-muted"> - Not trying to make myself feel better this time. I was just board. I ate all of these within 10 minutes of each other.</span></p>

<ul>
<li>Banana</li>
<li>Apple</li>
<li>String Cheese</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Dinner</strong> <span class="text-muted"> - Once again, I can't possibly cook and I'm exhausted from watching the baby, a pizza will do just fine...</span></p>

<ul>
<li>Pizza 6 pieces</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Snack</strong> <span class="text-muted"> - Feeling utter defeat as I look back at my day. One more apple will make it all healthy right?</span></p>

<ul>
<li>Apple</li>
</ul>


<p>I can't explain to you the low I felt as I took the last bite of that pizza last night. I had eaten 6 pieces all by myself. I looked down and saw myself hovering over a coffee table, watching a movie, pizza box next to me. I was utterly disgusted. I threw away the rest of the pizza and ate an apple a hour or so later as if it would cleanse my body or make up for the pizza in some way.</p>

<p>It was the tipping point. I finally could see I can't do this anymore. This is not who I want to be. This is not what I want to teach my son to be. Someone once told me, "People like you an me, we just aren't built to be that fit", screw that! If you want to accept defeat fine, But I won't be lumped into some statistic. I've made up my mind. I can do this, I will do this!</p>

<p>So how am I going to make the change? CrossFit <em>(hahah funny that is half of why I'm here)</em>, Insanity, Tae-Bo., Advocare... Nope, none of the above. In the immediate I'm going to stop eating fast food, lay off the sugar/sweets <em>(goodbye oreos, it was fun while it lasted)</em>, and increase the QUALITY of the food I eat. I'm going to use my analytical nature and desire to understand to my advantage. I plan to investigate and learn what my body NEEDS to fuel itself. Then I'm going to gain control over my currently PATHETICALLY WEAK willpower and make better choices. One day at a time.</p>

<p>I plan to post my progress here daily when I can but weekly at a minimum. Short term goal is a beach trip in two months. I'd like to think I could drop 15-20lbs by then but I want keep it realistic and focus on a lifestyle change. I want to take care of myself and teach my children to do the same. Our lives are a result of our choices. So what choice will you make today, Eat to live or live to Eat?</p>

			<h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2013/12/18/true-automation/">True Automation</a></h1>
      <small class="text-muted">Dec 18, 2013 12:35pm - Jonathan Simmons </small>
      <hr>
      <p>There are a lot of companies trying to make the "Minority Report" lifestyle a reality these days. <a href="http://www.insteon.com">Insteon</a> and <a href="http://www.x10.com/">x10</a> are old favorites that have been around for years. More recently, companies like <a href="http://smartthings.com">Smart Things</a> are taking Insteon and x10's tricks and packaging them as more modern products. The nerd in me would LOVE to have an automated home system. Is it practical? No. Does that matter? No.</p>

<p>A few years ago I had a whole budget set aside for an Insteon setup. I was going to spend ~$2000 and have each room on automated lights and a bunch of other fancy tricks. After about a month of planning, reason (aka, my wife), won me over and I decided against the whole setup. Now, just because I didn't actually go through with it back then doesn't mean I've given up on the idea (my wife sighs somewhere in the distance). I continue to keep my eye on the home automation world, hoping that one day I'll be able to have an automated house. Problem is, every time I revisit the idea I find that it's still impractically priced and just not useful. Why? because the automation companies today are building products that will sell as cool toys at Brookstone. They're not useful, practical, home automation tools. Let me explain.</p>

<p>Let's use Smart Things for example. They sell a few products that, depending on your configuration, can provide the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Automated Lights</li>
<li>Be informed of window(s) and door(s) opening/closing</li>
<li>Track temps and motion in a room or on a given object</li>
<li>Know when people come and go</li>
</ul>


<p>Then they partner with quite a few other companies like GE, Schlage, Kwikset and others to provide you with automation products they don't build. Locks, fire alarms, etc.</p>

<p>I'll admit that at first glance of the Smart Things website, they appear to offer a fairly large array of options. Problem is, it's just not practical. To use their system in every room of my house, I'd need the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Door locks: 3 x $200 = $600</li>
<li>Sensors for windows: 8 X 50 = $400</li>
<li>Light accessory for each room: 6 x 50 = $300</li>
<li>A couple motion sensors for fun: 2 x $50 = $100</li>
<li>The Smart Things hub: $100</li>
</ul>


<p>At this point I've spent $1500 to unlock my front door and turn on the lights with my smart phone vs. conventional methods.</p>

<p>Which brings me to my next point. Just because my phone is as smart as a computer doesn't mean I want to "whip it out" to turn on the lights or unlock a door. If I walk in a room and my phone is in my pocket, it's easier to just flip the light switch on the wall than to dig for my phone and open an app. The lights should just turn on when I enter, or via some voice queue. Likewise, trying to get into my house with stuff in my hands would be easier if i didn't have to unlock the door (ignoring that we still have to turn the handle). If I have to put things down to pull out my phone I might as well grab a key. In this scenario, the problem can't be solved by the door just detecting that I'm present either. I don't want it to unlock just because of my proximity. So, we need a better way to solve the problem.</p>

<p>A mobile app to turn on lights or unlock doors is cool but it's just not useful and definitely not going to make the "Minority Report" automated lifestyle a reality. I'm not saying I want everything to be a virtual screen that we wave our hands at, but we've got to do better than extra 3" dongles plugged into our outlets and needing to open an smart phone app to accomplish anything.</p>

<p>What is the answer?
Ultimately, I think technology is still a long way from supporting home automation that would be useful. Technologies like Bluetooth and battery consumption have a long way to go before we can rely on them to make our life simpler.</p>

<p>I do think there are some companies beginning to move in the right direction. <a href="http://nest.com">Nest</a> being one of them. I'll admit the Nest products are not exactly affordable, BUT they do seem to get the idea of what home automation is meant to be. Their products have a "set it and forget it" mindset. I CAN access it and make changes with a smart phone but it's not required for the device to function.</p>

<p>Here's to hoping one day home automation is useful. Then again, I don't want every store I walk in to know I'm out of shorts, maybe "Miniority Report" is a bad model...</p>

      <small class="text-muted">Oct 29, 2013 12:50am - Jonathan Simmons </small>
      <hr>
      <p>I've written a post or two about new seasons in my time on the internet. Sure, most of them were in my MySpace teenage-angst years, but those count too, don't they?</p>

<p>Fall is upon us and while most people don't think of fall as the season of new beginnings, for me that is exactly what this year is. I branched out on my own as a freelance developer in June of this year, after two years of working at <a href="http://hivemind.co" target="_blank">Hivemind Labs</a>. If independent freelancing wasn't enough to impress you, my first child, <a href="http://instagram.com/cohengsimmons" target="_blank">Cohen Gray</a>, was born a month later. Today I feel as though time is flying and standing still at the same time. I treasure each moment with my son as I see him change and grow every day. Yet I feel like progressing my skills can be so slow moving. There is so much to learn, to see and take in. Who has time for it all?</p>

<p>The answer? No one. Well, maybe.</p>

<p>I'm beginning to see that people who make something of themselves don't complain about their lack of time, they just get out and make things happen. No matter what it takes, they get up, get out, get inspired and do something awesome. I've determined it's high time I stop making excuses and just start making things happen. Let's see where this road leads...</p>
