			<h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2013/12/16/true-automation/">True Automation</a></h1>
      <small class="text-muted">Dec 16, 2013 12:35pm - Jonathan Simmons </small>
      <hr>
      <p>There are a lot of companies trying to make the "Minority Report" lifestyle a reality these days. <a href="http://www.insteon.com">Insteon</a> and <a href="http://www.x10.com/">x10</a> are old favorites that have been around for years. More recently companies like <a href="http://smartthings.com">Smart Things</a> are taking Insteon and x10's tricks and packaging them as more modern products.</p>

<p>The nerd in me LOVE to have an automated home system. Is it practical? No. Does that matter? No. A few years ago I had a whole budget set aside for an Insteon setup. I was gonna spend ~$2000 and have each room on automated light and a bunch of other fancy tricks. After about a month of planning, reason (aka my wife), won over and I decided against the whole setup. Now, just because I didn't actually go through with it back then doesn't mean I've given up on the idea (my wife sighs somewhere in the distance). I continue to keep my eye on the home automation world, hoping that one day I'll be able to have an automated house. Problem is, every time I revisit the idea I find that it's still impractically priced and just not useful. Why? because the automation companies today are building products that will sell as cool toys at Brookstone not useful, practical home automation tools. Let me explain.</p>

<p>Lets use Smart Things for example. They sell a few products that depending on your configuration can provide the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Automated Lights</li>
<li>Be informed of Window(s) and door(s) opening closing</li>
<li>Track temps and motion in a room or on  a given object</li>
<li>Know when people come and go.</li>
</ul>


<p>Then they partner with quite a few other companies like GE, Schlage, Kwikset and others to provide you with automation products they don't build. Locks, fire alarms, etc.</p>

<p>I'll admit that first glance of the Smart Things site it appears to be a fairly large array of options. Problem is, it just not practical. to use their system in every room of my house I'd need the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Door locks: 3 x $200 = $600</li>
<li>Sensors for windows: 8 X 50 = $400</li>
<li>Light accessory for each: 6 x 50 = $300</li>
<li>Couple motion sensors for fun: 2 x $50 = $100</li>
<li>The Smart Things hub: $100</li>
</ul>


<p>At this point I've spent $1500 to unlock my front door and turn on lights with my smart phone vs conventional methods.</p>

<p>Which brings me to my next point. Just because my phone is as smart computer doesn't mean I want to whip it out to turn on the lights or unlock a door. If I walk in a room and my phone is in my pocket it's easier to just flip the light switch on the wall than dig for my phone and open an app. The lights should just turn on when I enter, or via some voice queue. Likewise trying to get into my house with stuff in my hands would be easier if i didn't have to unlock the door (ignoring that we still have to turn the handle), but if I have to put things down to pull out my phone I might as well grab a key. That problem can't be solved by the door just detecting I'm present either. I don't want it to unlock just because of my proximity. So again we need a better way to solve the problem.</p>

<p>A mobile app to turn on lights or unlock doors is cool but it's just not useful and definitely not going to make the "Minority Report" automated lifestyle a reality. I'm not saying I want everything to be a virtual screen that we wave our hands at, but we've got to do better than extra 3" dongles plugged into our outlets and needing to open an smart phone app to accomplish anything.</p>

<p>What is the answer?
Ultimate I think technology is still a long way from supporting home automation that would be useful. Technologies like Bluetooth and battery consumption have a long way to go before we can rely on them to do make our life simpler.</p>

<p>I do think there are a companies beginning to move in the right direction. <a href="http://nest.com">Nest</a> being one of them. I'll admit the Nest products are not exactly affordable, BUT they do seem to get the idea of what home automation is meant to be. Their products have a set it and forget it mindset. I CAN access it and make changes with a smart phone but it's not required for the device to function.</p>

<p>Here's to hoping one day home automation is useful. Then again I don't want every store I walk in to know I'm out of shorts, maybe "Miniority Report" is a bad model...</p>

      <small class="text-muted">Oct 29, 2013 12:50am - Jonathan Simmons </small>
      <hr>
      <p>I've written a post or two about new seasons in my time on the internet. Sure, most of them were in my MySpace teenage-angst years, but those count too, don't they?</p>

<p>Fall is upon us and while most people don't think of fall as the season of new beginnings, for me that is exactly what this year is. I branched out on my own as a freelance developer in June of this year, after two years of working at <a href="http://hivemind.co" target="_blank">Hivemind Labs</a>. If independent freelancing wasn't enough to impress you, my first child, <a href="http://instagram.com/cohengsimmons" target="_blank">Cohen Gray</a>, was born a month later. Today I feel as though time is flying and standing still at the same time. I treasure each moment with my son as I see him change and grow every day. Yet I feel like progressing my skills can be so slow moving. There is so much to learn, to see and take in. Who has time for it all?</p>

<p>The answer? No one. Well, maybe.</p>

<p>I'm beginning to see that people who make something of themselves don't complain about their lack of time, they just get out and make things happen. No matter what it takes, they get up, get out, get inspired and do something awesome. I've determined it's high time I stop making excuses and just start making things happen. Let's see where this road leads...</p>
