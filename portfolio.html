<!-- 	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<hr>
	<p>My name is Jonathan Simmons - a Ruby on Rails developer based in Baton Rouge, LA. I've spent the last two years honing my code skillz and being generally awesome at the internet. If your interested in the gory details check out my <a href="/resume">resume</a>.</p>

	<p>I'm passionate about helping clients identify and solve their problems. For me this doesn't mean the client is always right, but it doesn't mean I'm always right either. Projects are about collaboration, and finding a balance between knowledge and skill.</p>

	<p>My previous business partner and I had a saying for this:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>"We think design should have a purpose, products should solve problems and the
greatest ideas are those born from necessity & collaboration."</p>
	</blockquote>
